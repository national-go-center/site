	h2#location Location
		
	:markdown-it
		The National Go Center is located at 4642 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016,
		two blocks north of the [Tenleytown Metro Station](https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/tenleytown.cfm).
		
		It's directly above the [Satay Club](http://www.asiansatayclub.com/) restaurant
		and a [Papa John's](https://www.papajohns.com/locations/usa/dc/washington/20016/4656-wisconsin-ave/837),
		both of which come highly recommended by NGC volunteers. Their takeout and pizza
		has fueled many fierce games of go.
		
		The NGC kitchen has a Keurig pot for coffee ($1 suggested donation) and an
		electric tea kettle for other hot drinks. (We usually have a good supply of
		green tea, though contributions are welcome.)

	h2#parking Parking
		
	:markdown-it
		The residential streets off Wisconsin Avenue, such as Chesapeake, have
		mostly two-hour, zoned parking that becomes unlimited after 6 PM on
		weekdays and on weekends, so parking is usually relatively easy.
		
		Weekdays before 6 PM, it's hard to find parking if you need to stay
		for longer than two hours—the closest unzoned parking is about five
		blocks west of the center.
		
	h2#schedule Hours &amp; Schedule
		
	:markdown-it
		The NGC is staffed entirely by volunteers, who come in at different times
		during the week to open the doors and tables to the community.
		
		For the current schedule, please check our [calendar](http://calendar.nationalgocenter.org)
		for up-to-date listings of when the doors are open throughout the week,
		tournaments, classes, and other special events.
		
		This is the rough weekly schedule, but be sure to check the
		calendar for current information.
